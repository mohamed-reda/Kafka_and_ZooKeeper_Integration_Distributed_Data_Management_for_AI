Great! Since you've completed **Step 2** (downloading Kafka), let's move on to setting up and using **ZooKeeper** for your Kafka installation. ZooKeeper is traditionally used by Kafka for cluster coordination, leader election, and metadata management [[2]]. Although Kafka 3.9.0 supports **KRaft mode** (which eliminates the need for ZooKeeper), we'll focus on using ZooKeeper as per your preference.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to set up and use ZooKeeper with Kafka:

---

### **Step 1: Create Required Directories**

Before starting ZooKeeper, you need to create directories where ZooKeeper will store its data.

1. Navigate to your Kafka directory:
   ```bash
   cd D:\kafka_2.13-3.9.0
   ```

2. Create a folder for ZooKeeper data:
   ```bash
   mkdir zookeeper-data
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Configure `zookeeper.properties`**

The `zookeeper.properties` file contains the configuration settings for ZooKeeper.

1. Open the `config/zookeeper.properties` file in a text editor (e.g., Notepad++):
   ```bash
   notepad config\zookeeper.properties
   ```

2. Update the `dataDir` property to point to the directory you just created:
   ```properties
   dataDir=C:/kafka_2.13-3.9.0/zookeeper-data
   ```

   This tells ZooKeeper where to store its data files [[4]].

---

### **Step 3: Start ZooKeeper**

Once the configuration is complete, you can start the ZooKeeper server.

1. Open a **Command Prompt** and navigate to your Kafka directory:
   ```bash
   cd D:\kafka_2.13-3.9.0
   ```

2. Start ZooKeeper using the following command:
   ```bash
   .\bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat .\config\zookeeper.properties
   ```

    - If everything is set up correctly, you should see logs indicating that ZooKeeper has started successfully.
    - ZooKeeper will listen on port `2181` by default [[9]].

---

### **Step 4: Verify ZooKeeper**

To confirm that ZooKeeper is running properly, you can connect to it using the `zkCli` tool (ZooKeeper Command Line Interface).

1. Open a new **Command Prompt** and run the following command:
   ```bash
   .\bin\windows\zkCli.bat
   ```

2. Once connected, you can issue commands like:
   ```bash
   ls /
   ```
   This lists the root nodes in ZooKeeper. If you see output like `[zookeeper]`, ZooKeeper is working correctly [[4]].

---

### **Step 5: Configure Kafka to Use ZooKeeper**

Now that ZooKeeper is running, you need to configure Kafka to connect to it.

1. Open the `config/server.properties` file in a text editor:
   ```bash
   notepad config\server.properties
   ```

2. Ensure the following properties are set:
   ```properties
   zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181
   log.dirs=C:/kafka_2.13-3.9.0/kafka-logs
   ```

    - The `zookeeper.connect` property tells Kafka where to find the ZooKeeper instance.
    - The `log.dirs` property specifies where Kafka will store its log files [[9]].

---

### **Step 6: Start Kafka Broker**

With ZooKeeper running, you can now start the Kafka broker.

1. Open a new **Command Prompt** and navigate to your Kafka directory:
   ```bash
   cd D:\kafka_2.13-3.9.0
   ```

2. Start the Kafka broker using the following command:
   ```bash
   .\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties
   ```

    - If everything is configured correctly, you should see logs indicating that the Kafka broker has started successfully.
    - Kafka will listen on port `9092` by default [[9]].

---

### **Step 7: Test Kafka with ZooKeeper**

Now that both ZooKeeper and Kafka are running, you can test the setup by creating a topic, producing messages, and consuming them.

1. **Create a Topic**:
    - Open a new **Command Prompt** and run:
      ```bash
      .\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --topic test-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
      ```

2. **Produce Messages**:
    - Start a producer to send messages:
      ```bash
      .\bin\windows\kafka-console-producer.bat --topic test-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
      ```
    - Type messages in the console and press Enter to send them.

3. **Consume Messages**:
    - Open another **Command Prompt** and start a consumer to read messages:
      ```bash
      .\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --topic test-topic --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
      ```

    - You should see the messages you sent being consumed in real-time.

### **Optional: Run ZooKeeper as a Windows Service**

If you want ZooKeeper to run in the background as a Windows service, you can configure it using tools like **NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager)** or by modifying the `zkServer.cmd` script [[10]].

---

### **Troubleshooting Tips**

1. **Port Conflicts**:
    - Ensure that ports `2181` (ZooKeeper) and `9092` (Kafka) are not being used by other applications.

2. **Firewall/Antivirus**:
    - Disable your firewall or antivirus temporarily if they block ZooKeeper or Kafka processes.

3. **WMIC Issues**:
    - If you encounter an error like `'wmic' is not recognized`, consider upgrading to a newer version of Windows or using WSL2 [[5]].

---

By following these steps, you should have a fully functional Kafka setup using ZooKeeper on Windows. If you encounter any issues or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

### **Troubleshooting Tips**

1. **WMIC Issues**:
    - If you encounter an error like `'wmic' is not recognized`, it may be due to the deprecation of `wmic` in newer Windows versions. Consider using WSL2 or manually setting up the environment variables [[5]].

2. **Port Conflicts**:
    - Ensure that ports `9092` (Kafka) and `2181` (ZooKeeper) are not being used by other applications.

3. **Firewall/Antivirus**:
    - Disable your firewall or antivirus temporarily if they block Kafka processes.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully set up and use Kafka on Windows. If you encounter any specific issues, feel free to ask for further assistance!
